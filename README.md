## aspen-agent-typescript-starter

A template for setting up an Aspen agent with Typescript.

### Getting started

If you haven't already download the Aspen cli

```
yarn global add aspen
# or
npm install -g aspen
# and login
aspen login
```

And initialize your agent project

```
aspen agent:init [<path_to_project>]
```

### Counter agent

Along with this project comes a counter agent, which you can increment until you reach space...or beyond.

See how to interact with agents in the documentation (TODO).
